# Mount Rainier Climbing Weather Optimization in Tableau

#Synopsis
**Problem**: Optimize climbing schedules for success rates and revenue. 

**Solution**: Developed regression analysis model in Tableau using climbing and weather data

**Insights**: Data storytelling shows success rates strongly correlate with weather conditions.

**Recommendation**: Implement data-driven scheduling to increase successful climbs and revenue.
